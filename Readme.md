There are a few things you can do to improve on my code and I challenge you to do some of these things:

Replace my createStrings() methods with method in strings.xml

How would you make my design better? implement your dream UI

My High and low on the forecast is wrong, how would you improve that data that comes back to the service?

Create a new Activity and show more details on individual dates
    clue: you can set data in intents with a key and retrieve it in the new activity

I have a few redundant methods, how would you clean that up?

Can you add the additional components from the project into the app?
